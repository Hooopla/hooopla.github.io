        <p class="text">
          Inspired by the theme of this website, my programming journey began
          with Minecraft. At just 10 years old, I started experimenting with the
          game’s in-built mechanics, using them to create interactive elements
          and simple games. This early curiosity eventually led me to develop
          custom servers, leveraging only Minecraft’s native tools. By high
          school, I discovered Skript—a powerful plugin that enables developers
          to extend and customize gameplay—expanding my ability to bring my
          ideas to life, from designing a fishing-based server to building a
          fully immersive MMORPG.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Reflecting on these experiences, I’m grateful for the foundation they
          laid in my childhood, sparking my ambition to pursue Software
          Engineering. Today, I’m driven by the vision of creating software that
          makes a meaningful impact in people’s lives.

        <p class="text">
          Implemented and analyzed four distinct 2x2 matrix multiplication
          algorithms in C, C++, and x86 Assembly, utilizing techniques such as
          direct array access, unsafe math optimizations, memory addressing with
          registers, and stack manipulation. This study explored performance
          variations and computational efficiencies across different programming
          approaches.

          Designed and optimized database models to effectively organize and
          track Simon Fraser University’s departmental and course data.
          Developed a comprehensive system for monitoring seat availability and
          historical intake data dating back to 2008, enhancing data
          accessibility and supporting informed decision-making.

        <h2>Fishers (Minecraft Server)</h2>
        <p class="text">
          I am passionate about game development, and upon learning how to
          create custom Minecraft servers, I was inspired to design a unique
          server that transformed Minecraft’s existing fishing mechanics into a
          fully engaging game. I’m proud to say that this project attracted over
          100 daily active users during its peak, reflecting its popularity and
          the enjoyment it brought to the community.

          Developed an educational tool to introduce users to foundational words
          and phrases in the Blackfoot (Siksiká) language, spoken by the
          Blackfoot Nation. This project aimed to raise awareness of how
          technology and software development can support the preservation of
          endangered languages and foster greater cultural understanding.
